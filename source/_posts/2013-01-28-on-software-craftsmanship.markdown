I consider myself a software craftsman. So when I read the article <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/community/?q=node/8649" title="On the Dark Side of Craftsmanship">On the Dark Side of "Craftsmanship"</a>, you may think I was a little upset at this article's summary of what software craftsmanship truly entails. However, I was not. In fact, I not only agree with the tone and some of the points in the article, but have experienced some of these exact same things. I tend to feel that the meaning of software craftsmanship is not only misunderstood by "software laborers," but by software craftsmen as well. This is my attempt to better define the driving motivation behind craftsmanship. <!--More-->

We are All Software Craftsmen

Software craftsmanship is not about great code. It is not about being better than others. It is not about staying
late or coming in early and is certainly not about ridiculing others for their work. {"Software craftsmanship is about
improving oneself and ones craft"}; a constant pursuit of improvement and the realization that there will always be
room for more improvement to come. Take pride in your work. If you accomplish some feat of elegant code and solution,
 pat yourself on the back; but never do so for long. Finishing something worthwhile is only the beginning of starting
  its improvement.

In this sense, we are **all** software craftsmen. No one is left out or left behind. No one is omitted from the need
for improvement. We all have room for growth and there is no need to criticise another. Promoting
{"craftsmanship means helping others achieve"} and destructive behavior or comments have no positive benefit. As
mentioned
 in the article, <a href="http://harthur.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/771/">Heather Arthur was ridiculed</a> for code
 released to the community. How does this help Heather
 become a
  better developer or help improve quality? How does this help those commenting become better developers? Simply put:
  it does not.
{% endpullquote %}

No one lacks the need for improvement; learn from one another regardless of years of experience or rank.

**We are not experts. We are software craftsmen and we are all in this
together.**
